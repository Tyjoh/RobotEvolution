Big Features
	Skeletal Animation
	Animation controller System
	Circle vs Rectangle vs Triangle collision
	Collision events and response

General TODO:
	Integrate Math library
	Robust game loop
	Custom Art		
	
Skeletal Animation TODO:
	Z order bones
	Clean up loose ends and hacky/unused methods
	Documentation
	
Animation Controller System TODO:
	Design a system that can easily control bones based on physical properties and events
	and configured via map editor and files
	Implement a Animation cache so animations get reused
	Implement a AnimationState class so entities can more robustly manage their animation states
	Implement an Algorithm for displaying a skeleton pose at any given animation time
		(for animation editor)

Collision Detection TODO:
	Circle VS AABB VS Triangle
	VS Oriented Bodies(Not urgent)

Collision Events and Response TODO:
	Respond to collisions based on entity/collision type
	Respond to collisions based on collision location

Physicaly interactive objects TODO:
	reuse map collision code but apply resolution to objects that should be affected
	Ridable objects
	objects that push the player

Particles TODO:
	Emitters
	emit given a texture
	emit based on underlying texture
	partialy physicaly interactive (depending on approach)

Graphics TODO:
	Normal maps
	Lighting
	glow maps

Level scripting TODO:
	events based on time
	events based on collision / proximity
	events based on switches / buttons




***Continue Map Editor when base game engine is stable and not subject to major changes***

MapEditor  TODO:
	saving level
	loading level
	remove components
	componentDependencies
	auto add component dependencies
	fix zoom so camera zooms in on mouse cursor
	move entity via click/drag
	start values panel at bottom
	add toolbar
	tile set loader
	tile selector
	store tile to collision mapping
